  <!-- ABOUT ME -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2><i data-lucide="user-check"></i> About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a dedicated computer science student combining online education with full-time employment in the UK. I study Computer Science with a specialization in Business Application Programming. My goal is to grow in areas such as C#, .NET, and Laravel.
      <br><br>
      I currently work at <strong>Craven & Co Ltd</strong> as a machine operator in the Wire Work department. My responsibilities include creating machine programs based on technical drawings and operating various machines (Shlatter, Ideal, Ultimat, Wafios, Gem, and others), setting parameters, maintenance, quality control, and I also possess TIG welding skills. For a long time, I worked the second shift, where I independently managed the entire Wire Work department. During this time, my tasks reflected those of a coordinator – planning work, supporting the team, and solving technical and organizational issues.
      <br><br>
      I actively support new employees – I help them set up machines, introduce them to equipment operation, and teach them how to effectively develop their skills in a production environment. I'm currently expanding my competencies through training on the <strong>Wafios</strong> machine. As part of this, I created my own ChatGPT-based chatbot to assist with learning machine operations. I use artificial intelligence not only for automating and solving work-related issues but also in daily life – from planning tasks to developing creative projects.
      <br><br>
      Previously, I gained experience in a similar factory in Poland, which gave me a strong foundation in production work. I also worked for an extended period as a <strong>teleconsultant and sales representative</strong> at <strong>Orange</strong>, developing my communication and sales skills, and as a <strong>sales representative</strong> at <strong>Silver Computer</strong> in Nowy Sącz – where I handled customer relations and technical consulting.
      <br><br>
      I am developing not only as a programmer – I am also passionate about graphic and music creation. In my spare time, I design AI-generated graphics, edit short videos, and compose my own electronic music. I aim to grow my interests on every level – from technical to artistic. Creativity and a willingness to learn are my greatest strengths.
